We know that the area of a rectangle is given by\n\n\\[\nA = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n\\]\n\nSince both the length and the width are changing over time, we can think of them as functions of time \\( t \\) (that is, \\( L(t) \\) and \\( w(t) \\)). Thus, the area at any time \\( t \\) is\n\n\\[\nA(t) = L(t) \\times w(t)\n\\]\n\n**Follow-up Question:**  \nCan you explain in your own words why we write the area as a product \\( A(t) = L(t) \\times w(t) \\) when the dimensions depend on time? What does this tell you about how the area changes with time?"
