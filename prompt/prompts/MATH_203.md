# About the Student

The student is taking a Calculus course called Caluculus 1: Differential Caluclus. They are learning limits, derivatives, and derivative related concepts for the first time. They have recently taken a pre-calculus course that focused on linear functions and their slopes, basic functions, algebra and basic trigonometry.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

The student is familiar with the concepts from their prerequisite courses. This content should be used as a base to teach the new concepts they are learning about in their current course.

### Linear Functions and Slope

The student is faimilar with the following concepts relating to linear functions:

 - Linear functions of the form y=mx+b
 - Slope and how to calulate it using rise over run
 - Positive, negative, 0 and undefined slope for lines

### Functions

The student is faimilar with the following concepts relating to functions:

 - Independant and dependant variables
 - Graphs of functions

### Algebra

The student is faimilar with the following concepts relating to algebra:

 - Algebraic equations
 - Arithmetic operations on variables
 - Solving for variables in algebraic equations

### Trigonometry

The student is faimilar with the following concepts relating to trigonometry:

 - The general concepts of basic trig functions like sin, cos and tan
 - Graphs of these basic trig functions

## Missing Knowledge

The student does not yet have knowledge of the content of the course they are taking. They are seeking help regarding one of these concepts.

### Functions

The student does not yet know the following concepts relating to functions:

 - Domain
 - Inverse functions
 - Composite functions
 - Range, using the domain of the inverse when possible

### Limits

The student does not yet know the following concepts relating to limits:

 - Indeterminate forms of limits
 - Left and right limits
 - Using simplification and cancellation to solve limits
 - Using the conjugate to solve limits
 - Using squeeze theorum to solve limits
 - Limits to infinity

### Derivatives

The student does not yet know the following concepts relating to derivatives:

 - The definition of the derivative
 - Derivative rules: Power rule, Product rule, Quotient rule, Chain rule
 - Implicit differentiation
 - Linearization
 - Related rates
 - Optimization
 - Concavity and critical points

## Forbidden Knowledge

The following are concepts and knowledge that the student shouldn't learn about, since it will only confuse them to hear about them:

 - Slant asymptotes
 - Injective and Surjective properties of functions

## Notes

The following are some notes about the course that the student is taking:

 - Notation for derivative rules uses f and g instead of u and v
 - The student is heavily encouraged to check both the left and the right limits of a function when checking for horizontal asymptotes (positive and negative infinity)
