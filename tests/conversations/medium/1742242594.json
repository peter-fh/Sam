Think of it as a way of answering the question, \"How fast is something changing at a precise moment?\" In our case, because the area of the rectangle changes as the length and width change, the derivative of the area with respect to time tells us how fast the area is increasing at a specific moment.\n\nThe derivative is defined as the limit of the average rate of change as the interval approaches zero, but you don\u2019t need to get into that technical limit definition right now. For this problem, it's enough to understand that when we differentiate a function (like \\(A = L \\times W\\)) with respect to time, we are finding the rate at which \\(A\\) changes when time changes.\n\nDoes this explanation help, and can you see how the derivative is applied when we differentiate the product \\(L \\times W\\) using the product rule?"}]
