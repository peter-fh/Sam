# About the Student

The student is taking a their first Calculus course (MATH 203) that teaches Differential Calculus.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

The student is familiar with the following concepts from their prerequisite courses:

 - Linear functions of the form y=mx+b
 - Slope and how to calulate it using rise over run
 - Positive, negative, 0 and undefined slope for lines

 - Graphs of functions

 - Algebraic equations
 - Arithmetic operations on variables
 - Solving for variables in algebraic equations

 - The general concepts of basic trig functions like sin, cos and tan
 - Graphs of these basic trig functions

## New Knowledge

The student does not know this content and is seeking help about one of them:

 - Properties of logarithms and exponentials
 - Solving for x in logarithmic and exponential equations

 - Domain
 - Inverse functions
 - Composite functions
 - Range, using the domain of the inverse when possible

 - Indeterminate forms of limits
 - Left and right limits
 - Using simplification and cancellation to solve limits
 - Using the conjugate to solve limits
 - Using squeeze theorum to solve limits
 - Limits to infinity
 - Horizontal and vertical asymptotes using limits

 - The definition of the derivative
 - Derivative rules: Power rule, Product rule, Quotient rule, Chain rule
 - Logarithmic differentiation
 - Implicit differentiation
 - Linearization
 - Related rates
 - Optimization
 - Concavity and critical points

## Excluded Concepts

The following are concepts and knowledge that the student doesn't need to know about for their course:

 - Slant asymptotes
 - Injective and Surjective properties of functions

## Notes

 - Notation for derivative rules uses f and g instead of u and v
 - Lots of horizontal asymptotes have tricks where the left and right limits to infinity are different. Please be careful about these questions.
 - The expression sqrt{x^2} should be treated as |x|, and if x \to -\infty then |x|=-x
