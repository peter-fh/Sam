That means the area \\(A\\) is also a function of \\(t\\).\n\n**Follow-up Question:**  \nHow would you write the equation for the rate of change of the area (\\(\\frac{dA}{dt}\\)) in terms of \\(L\\), \\(W\\), \\(\\frac{dL}{dt}\\), and \\(\\frac{dW}{dt}\\)?

By using the **product rule** for differentiation, we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = L \\frac{dW}{dt} + W \\frac{dL}{dt}.\n\\]\n\nThis formula shows that the rate at which the area changes is influenced by how fast the width and length are changing, each weighted by the current length and width, respectively.\n\n**Follow-up Question:**  \nWith \\(L = 20\\) cm, \\(W = 12\\) cm, \\(\\frac{dL}{dt} = 8\\) cm/s, and \\(\\frac{dW}{dt} = 5\\) cm/s, how would you now compute \\(\\frac{dA}{dt}\\) using the expression we derived?
