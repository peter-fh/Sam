# About the Student

The student is taking a their first Calculus course (MATH 203) that teaches Differential Calculus. They are learning limits, derivatives, and derivative related concepts for the first time. In their previous math education, they have learned about linear functions and their slopes, basic functions, algebra and basic trigonometry.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

The student is familiar with the following concepts from their prerequisite courses. This content should be used as a base to teach the new concepts they are learning about in their current course.

### Linear Functions and Slope

 - Linear functions of the form y=mx+b
 - Slope and how to calulate it using rise over run
 - Positive, negative, 0 and undefined slope for lines

### Functions

 - Independant and dependant variables
 - Graphs of functions

### Algebra

 - Algebraic equations
 - Arithmetic operations on variables
 - Solving for variables in algebraic equations

### Trigonometry

 - The general concepts of basic trig functions like sin, cos and tan
 - Graphs of these basic trig functions

## Missing Knowledge

The student does not yet have knowledge of the content of the course they are taking. They are seeking help regarding one of these concepts.

### Functions

 - Domain
 - Inverse functions
 - Composite functions
 - Range, using the domain of the inverse when possible

### Limits

 - Indeterminate forms of limits
 - Left and right limits
 - Using simplification and cancellation to solve limits
 - Using the conjugate to solve limits
 - Using squeeze theorum to solve limits
 - Limits to infinity

### Derivatives

 - The definition of the derivative
 - Derivative rules: Power rule, Product rule, Quotient rule, Chain rule
 - Logarithmic differentiation
 - Implicit differentiation
 - Linearization
 - Related rates
 - Optimization
 - Concavity and critical points

## Forbidden Knowledge

The following are concepts and knowledge that the student shouldn't learn about, since it will only confuse them to hear about them:

 - Slant asymptotes
 - Injective and Surjective properties of functions

## Notes

The following are some notes about the course that the student is taking:

 - Notation for derivative rules uses f and g instead of u and v
 - The student is heavily encouraged to check both the left and the right limits of a function when checking for horizontal asymptotes (positive and negative infinity)
