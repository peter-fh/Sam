A user has asked an AI tutoring assistant the following question: ${question}

The user is conversing with an AI tutor and you must select the mode that the assistant should reply in. They are currently in "Problem" mode, meaning they have just asked a conceptual question. The default should be to stay in this mode.

## Concept

If they ask a conceptual question that differs from the problem they have been solving, switch to "Concept" mode.

## Other

If they have just asked about study planning or study strategies, switch to "Other" mode. This mode is also best for generating practice problems, but only switch if multiple practice problems are asked for at once (i.e. for generating a practice exam)
