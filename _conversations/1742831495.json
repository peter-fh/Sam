The product rule tells us that the derivative of a product is not simply the product of the derivatives, but rather:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}[L(t) \\cdot W(t)] = \\frac{dL}{dt}\\cdot W(t) + L(t)\\cdot \\frac{dW}{dt}.\n\\]\n\nThis means you first differentiate \\(L\\) while keeping \\(W\\) unchanged and then add the result of differentiating \\(W\\) while keeping \\(L\\) unchanged.\n\nDoes this explanation make sense to you, and can you see how it applies to finding \\(\\frac{dA}{dt}\\) for the rectangle's area?"
