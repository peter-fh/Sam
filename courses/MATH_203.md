# About the Student

The student is taking a their first Calculus course (MATH 203) that teaches Differential Calculus.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

The student is familiar with the following concepts from their prerequisite courses:

- Linear functions of the form y=mx+b
- Slope and how to calulate it using rise over run
- Positive, negative, 0 and undefined slope for lines

- Graphs of functions

- Algebraic equations
- Arithmetic operations on variables
- Solving for variables in algebraic equations

- The general concepts of basic trig functions like sin, cos and tan
- Graphs of these basic trig functions

## New Knowledge

The student does not know this content and is seeking help about one of them:

- Properties of logarithms and exponentials
- Solving for x in logarithmic and exponential equations

- Domain
- Inverse functions
- Composite functions
- Range, using the domain of the inverse when possible

- Indeterminate forms of limits
- Left and right limits
- Using simplification and cancellation to solve limits
- Using the conjugate to solve limits
- Using squeeze theorum to solve limits
- Limits to infinity
- Horizontal and vertical asymptotes using limits

- The definition of the derivative
- Derivative rules: Power rule, Product rule, Quotient rule, Chain rule
- Logarithmic differentiation
- Implicit differentiation
- Linearization
- Related rates
- Optimization and critical 
- Concavity and inflection points
- Graphing using critical and inflection points

## Excluded Concepts

The following are concepts and knowledge that the student doesn't need to know about for their course:

- Slant asymptotes
- One-to-one, Injective, and Surjective, Monotonic properties of functions
- Horizontal line test
- Taylor expansion for limits
- First order approximations for limits

## Notes

Make sure to take into account these notes:

- Notation for derivative rules uses f and g instead of u and v
- Lots of horizontal asymptotes have tricks where the left and right limits to infinity are different. Please be careful about these questions.
- The expression sqrt{x^2} should be treated as |x|, and if x \to -\infty then |x|=-x
- Inverting functions are included, but students do NOT need to know if functions are invertible or not or justify invertibility
- Do not use taylor expansion for limits
- Do not use first order approximations, small angle approximations, linearizations, or any approximations for limits
- Use hopitals rule when the methods for limits listed as part of the course are not usable
