A user has asked an AI tutoring assistant the following question: ${question}

Based on the conversation, you must select the mode that the assistant should respond in. The modes are as follows:

## Problem

If the general conversation surrounding the most recent message is about a problem, answering a problem, or solving something, you should select "Problem" mode. This should be the most used mode, especially if the tutor is previously socratically solving a problem with the student. If the thread is of a problem being solved, you should only switch to other modes in special cases.

## Concept

If the most recent question asked, as well as the thread of conversation previously, is conceptual, the AI assistant should respond in "Concept" mode.


## Other

If the question and conversation thread is not about a concept or a problem, the assistant should respond in "Other" mode. Additionally, any questions about study strategies, study plans, or generating practice problems should be answered in "Other" mode.
