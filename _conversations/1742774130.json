We use the area formula\n\n\\[\nA = L \\times W\n\\]\n\nbecause the problem is asking for how fast the **area** of the rectangle is increasing. Since the area is defined as the product of its length and width, we need to relate the change in area to the change in length and width.\n\nBy expressing the area in terms of \\( L \\) and \\( W \\), we can apply the product rule from calculus to differentiate with respect to time. Differentiating gives us a direct connection between the rates of change: the rate at which the area changes depends on both how fast the length and the width are changing.\n\nDoes this explanation help clarify why we started with the area formula?
