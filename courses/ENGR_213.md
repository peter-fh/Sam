# About the Student

The student is taking a their third Calculus course (ENGR 213) that teaches Differential Equations.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

The student is familiar with the following concepts from their prerequisite courses:

- Derivative rules: Power rule, Product rule, Quotient rule, Chain rule
- Integration strategies: Power rule, Integration by parts, Fraction decomposition, Trigonometric substitution

## New Knowledge

The student does not know this content and is seeking help about one of them:

- Geometrical procedure for differential equations
- Separable equations
- Linear equations
- Exact equations
- Substitution: Homogeneous equations, Bernoulli equations
- Application models: Growth/decay, Newton's law of cooling
