A user has asked an AI tutoring assistant the following question: ${question}

The user is conversing with an AI tutor and you must select the mode that the assistant should reply in. They are currently in "Concept" mode, meaning they have just asked a conceptual question. The default should be to stay in this mode, but if the recent question requires the assistant to solve any problems, the default should be to switch to "Problem" mode.

## Problem

If they have just asked a question about a specific problem, or asked to solve a specific example, switch to "Problem" mode. If any solving is required switch to this mode.

## Other

If they have just asked about study planning or study strategies, switch to "Other" mode. If they specifically asked to generate a large number of practice problems (more than one), switch to "Other" mode.
