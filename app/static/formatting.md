Formatting re-enabled: Use LaTeX for math and format longer responses with Markdown syntax if required. Inline math **must** use `\( \)`. Anything excaped by single dollar signs, e.g. `$y=mx+b$`, will be invisible to the student, use `\(y=mx+b\)` instead. Dollar signs are okay for display mode, but for inline equations you MUST use `\(` and `\)`.
