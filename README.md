# MAT Tutoring AI

This project is a prototype of a tutoring AI that uses ChatGPT. It sends specialized prompts that contain the relevant information about specific courses that a student is taking and asking questions about. It also contains specific instructions in order to respond to each question and type of question in the most helpful ways.

This branch is used for my personal studies. I wanted to keep a public record of the way I was using this to show how it can be useful beyond the prototype course.

I am constantly updating prompts for my personal courses to ensure they are the most accurate. It started by copying the syllabus, however the concepts mentioned in it are too general and I am consistantly needing to update them. None of these courses will be up to the standard of MATH 203, however, since that prompt was designed using the knowledge of what students know and need help with gained from a year of tutoring students in this course.

## Deployment

This branch is not deployed. I am using my personal API key, paying for my own credits, so that I can avoid paying for a chatgpt subscription, paying only for API credits.

## Contributing

I wouldn't recommend contributing to this branch, however contributions are more than welcome on the main branch. Forking the project and using it for personal use, however, would be a great way to test this method of AI tutoring.

## Front end
