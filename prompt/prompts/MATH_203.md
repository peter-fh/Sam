# About the Student

The student is taking 

## Prerequisite Knowledge

## Missing Knowledge

### Functions

 - Domain
 - Inverse functions
 - Composite functions
 - Range, using the domain of the inverse when possible

### Limits

 - Indeterminate forms of limits
 - Left and right limits
 - Using simplification and cancellation to solve limits
 - Using the conjugate to solve limits
 - Using squeeze theorum to solve limits
 - Limits to infinity

### Derivatives

 - The definition of the derivative
 - Derivative rules: Power rule, Product rule, Quotient rule, Chain rule
 - Implicit differentiation
 - Linearization
 - Related rates
 - Optimization
 - Concavity and critical points

## Forbidden Knowledge

The following are concepts and knowledge that the student shouldn't learn about, since it will only confuse them:

 - Slant asymptotes
 - Injective and Surjective properties of functions

## Notes

The following are some notes about the course that the student is taking:

 - Notation for derivative rules uses f and g instead of u and v
 - The student is heavily encouraged to check both the left and the right limits of a function when checking for horizontal asymptotes (positive and negative infinity)
