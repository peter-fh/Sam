In this problem, both \\(l\\) and \\(w\\) are functions of time, so the area \\(A\\) is also a function of time.\n\n**Step 1: Differentiating with Respect to Time**\n\nWhen we differentiate \\(A = l \\times w\\) with respect to time \\(t\\), we need to use the product rule. Do you recall the product rule and how it\u2019s applied in this context? (Hint: The derivative with respect to time is expressed as:  \n\\[\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = l \\frac{dw}{dt} + w \\frac{dl}{dt}.\n\\]  \nSometimes the order is written as \\(\\frac{dA}{dt} = l \\frac{dl}{dt} + w \\frac{dw}{dt}\\); it depends on how we label the rates. In our case, since \\(l\\) changes at 8 cm/s and \\(w\\) changes at 5 cm/s, we want them in the appropriate spots.)\n\nCould you take a moment to explain how you'd apply the product rule to get \\(\\frac{dA}{dt}\\) from \\(A = l \\times w\\)?"}]
